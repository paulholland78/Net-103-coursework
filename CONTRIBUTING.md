# Contributing

In order to ensure clean code and good partner collaboration, the following development guidelines should be adhered to.

### Programming style
* Good commenting is almost a must with assembly. Prefix any files created with a block comment explaining the purpose of the file, the author and the date.

### Using Git and GitHub
* Make sure that when pulling code from a repository (using `git pull`) that the configuration is set to `rebase`, instead of creating an additional and unneeded merge commit. This can be done using `git config --global pull.rebase true`.
